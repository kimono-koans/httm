$equine is a script to mount APFS snapshots for use with $httm.  
$equine has two modes: 1) mount and unmount of local APFS snapshots, 
and 2) mount and unmount of remote APFS snapshots, located on a Time 
Machine network volume (NAS).  

This script is *not* for use with Time Machines which utilize direct 
attached storage (DAS).

USAGE:
	equine [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
	--mount-local:
		Attempt to mount your local Time Machine snapshots.

	--unmount-local:
		Attempt to unmount your local Time Machine snapshots.

	--mount-remote:
		Attempt to mount your remote Time Machine snapshots and the Time 
		Machine image file, and connect the server.

	--unmount-remote:
		Attempt to unmount your remote Time Machine snapshots and the Time 
		Machine image file, and disconnect the server.

	--help:
		Display this dialog.

	--version:
		Display script version.
